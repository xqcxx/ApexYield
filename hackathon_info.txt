Programming USDCx on Stacks - Builder Challenge
Welcome to the Programming USDCx on Stacks Builder Challenge! This event runs from January 19 to January 25, 2026, and takes place entirely online. Brought to you by Stacks Labs, this challenge focuses on unleashing the creative potential of the global developer community to integrate USDCx on Stacks via a programmatic bridge.

USDCx on Stacks opens up stablecoin liquidity into its decentralized ecosystem via Circle's xReserve protocol. This enables asset transfers from Ethereum and enhances Stacks' DeFi offerings. Users access Stacks' DeFi, maintaining stable assets, increasing liquidity, and providing a reliable option for transactions and investments.

Deposits are initiated on Ethereum and automatically minted on Stacks, while withdrawals are initiated on Stacks and settled on Ethereum. The bridging process is powered by Circle’s xReserve and the Stacks attestation service.

Our primary goal is to encourage developers to build groundbreaking applications and integrations powered by USDCx, helping to bring liquidity from Ethereum to Stacks. With a $3,000 USD cash prize (winner-takes-all) and no track divisions, all types of ideas competing head-to-head in one open category!
